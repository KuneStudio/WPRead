WPRead

Hi. WPRead is a Wordpress theme that is meant to focused on the content. And content only.

One column only, if you not consider the collapsable menu, responsive.

The starter theme used is an Undescore generated theme.
If you have ideas to make the theme better, send me an email using the contact form at http://www.kune.fr

Demo coming soon!
